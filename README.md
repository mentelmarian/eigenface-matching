# eigenface-matching
Faces matching based on the eigenfaces 
This repository is part of my master degree thesis at [Sapienza Univesit√† di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/) in computer engineering.

## Eigenface recognition

In this folder you will find a brief Jupiter notebook; it will use the content of *eigenfaces* folder to perform an identification scenario.
The matching is done using the squared Euclidean distance among the eigenfaces. In the *eigenfaces* folder you will find different lengths of the feature vector (from 1 to 12) of the first hundred faces of the [CASIA](http://biometrics.idealtest.org/downloadDB.do?id=4#/datasetDetail/9). Every face has 4 different variations.
